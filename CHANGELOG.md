# Changelog

All notable changes to SkillEvaluator are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Keep headings and comments inside fenced code examples in their enclosing Markdown
  section during Tier 2 content chunking, preserving original source line numbers.
- Run the public Docker image as an unprivileged user, with writable default report and home directories.
  Document UID/GID overrides for host-owned output mounts.
- Pin the HTML report Chart.js dependency and verify its integrity before browser execution.

- Preserve full Codex gateway model IDs in cloud environments, including E2B
  and Daytona, while retaining local runtime setup and native provider routing.
- Keep Tier 2 execution diagnostics visible alongside duplicate findings in
  CLI, HTML, and Markdown reports, without repeating the findings as errors.
- Use `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` as the shared NVIDIA Build default for
  evaluator chat, agent execution, and judging, preserving explicit model overrides.
  Request nonstreaming chat responses explicitly to match the response parser.
- Tier 2 LLM failures now identify the selected provider and model, HTTP status,
  safe error metadata, and failed-cluster count without exposing response bodies.
- Replace the retired NVIDIA embedding default with `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b`
  and send the required passage input type for NVIDIA document comparisons.
  Existing catalogs and caches must be rebuilt when switching embedding models.
- Report Tier 2 embedding and LLM service failures as incomplete checks, retaining
  a nonzero exit without inventing duplicate-content findings. Provider error
  messages include recovery guidance without echoing raw response bodies.

### Added

- Interactive top-level help now opens with a green SkillEvaluator wordmark,
  installed version, and tier overview. Narrow terminals use a compact header;
  redirected output and subcommands keep their existing output format.

- OpenAI-compatible gateways now have chat, embedding, and separate Codex,
  Claude Code, and OpenCode model defaults. Set the provider, URL, and key;
  override model IDs when the gateway uses different catalog names. Claude
  Code inherits the gateway route unless an explicit Anthropic route is set.
  Run reports identify harness defaults separately from CLI/config overrides.

- Run individual tiers directly with `skillevaluator tier1 PATH`, `tier2 PATH`,
  and `tier3 PATH`, while retaining the expert subcommands. Tier 1 includes
  dependency checks and enables LLM checks when configured; Tier 2 reports
  whether a catalog comparison ran; Tier 3 creates a missing starter dataset
  and preserves existing evaluation sources.

### Changed

- `validate PATH` now runs all three tiers for skills by default. Tier 3
  autopilot reuses an existing evaluation source or creates one starter case
  when none exists. `--full` remains compatible but is unnecessary;
  `--tiers`, `--no-tier3`, and `--no-autopilot` provide explicit scope controls.
  Keyless static CI gates should select `--tiers 1`.
- Tier 3 now selects a provider-native agent when `--agents` is omitted:
  OpenCode for NVIDIA Build, Codex for OpenAI, and Claude Code for Anthropic.
  NVIDIA Build agent runs default to Nemotron Super; explicit agent and model
  overrides remain unchanged.
- Tier 3's extra agent runtime preflight is now disabled by default because it
  executes the first real task prompt and incurs agent runtime and model cost.
  Enable it explicitly with `--agent-runtime-preflight` on either `tier3` or
  `validate`, or with `harbor.agent_runtime_preflight: true` in `evals/config.yml`.
- Missing-provider and API-key errors now show concise, copyable setup steps
  and a link to advanced configuration. Tier 1 also explains `--no-llm`.
- `tier1 validate` now runs only Tier 1, matching `tier1 PATH`. The top-level
  `validate` command retains its combined pipeline behavior.
- README and getting-started guides lead with provider-plus-key setup for
  NVIDIA Build and OpenAI, explain inherited model defaults, and separate
  credentials from scanner and agent runtime requirements.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Catalog validation now writes `catalog-summary.json` at the reports root with
  per-skill pass/fail status, optional severity rollups from child JSON reports,
  and paths to per-skill report directories.
- Catalog `validate` accepts `--workers N` to validate skills in parallel child
  processes (default 1 preserves the serial per-skill pipeline view).
- `SKILL_EVAL_MODEL_CATALOG_ALLOW_HTTP_HOSTS` names hosts whose model catalog may
  be read over plain HTTP. Catalog reads still require HTTPS for every other
  non-loopback host. Entries match one whole host as written, with no name
  resolution. A plain-HTTP request to an accepted host bypasses any inherited
  HTTP proxy so its bearer token is not offered to an intermediary. The
  transport rechecks authorization before dispatch and rejects hosts that
  are no longer allowed.
- Published benchmark cards record the evaluated source identity. `BENCHMARK.md`
  now carries `Evaluated source`, `Evaluated source revision` and
  `Evaluator container revision` as separate fields, so a reader can tell which
  source tree was evaluated apart from the evaluator build that evaluated it.
  Previously two skills evaluated from different repositories by the same
  evaluator container produced cards whose only recorded revision was the shared
  container tag. `validate` and `tier3 evaluate` take the identity as
  `--evaluated-source-repository`, `--evaluated-source-revision` and
  `--evaluator-container-revision`. `validate` records it on the card and in
  the top-level `evaluated_source` object of its JSON report and forwards it to
  every child of a parallel catalog run; both commands persist it into a Tier 3
  run's `run_config.json`. It can also arrive as the `evaluated_source`
  argument to `build_agent_eval_payload`, as an `evaluated_source` object in the
  run's `run_config.json`, or as `metadata["evaluated_source"]` on any
  validation result. It is never inferred from repository state while rendering,
  because the tree that renders a card is the evaluator checkout rather than the
  evaluated skill's source. Every populated carrier, including the payload of
  every Tier 3 result, is folded into one identity before any report is
  written, so carriers that disagree fail closed with nothing published instead
  of letting result ordering decide which source tree a card claims to describe.
  A revision is accepted only in an unambiguous shape: a full Git object id
  (40 or 64 hex characters), or a digest whose width matches the algorithm it
  names. A container revision is an image reference validated by component (a
  repository path of up to 255 characters, an optional tag of up to 128, and a
  digest at its algorithm's width), so a long repository name is no longer
  discarded. The 255 bound measures the path once the registry host is split
  off it. Path components are lower case, as the OCI grammar requires, while a
  registry host may use any case and is read as a host only when it is
  `localhost`, carries a dot, or carries a port.
  `check_public_benchmarks.py --require-source-provenance` requires the
  fields and fails any card publishing a `PASS` without them, including a
  `PASS` whose evaluator container is named by a mutable tag rather than
  pinned by digest. SkillEvaluator's own CI now runs the scan with that flag;
  it stays opt-in for trees whose cards predate the contract
  ([#72](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/72)).
- SARIF 2.1.0 reporter (`-r sarif`) for GitHub Code Scanning and other SARIF
  consumers. Findings map to rule IDs, severity levels, and file locations from
  Tier 1 validation results.

### Fixed

- `--no-llm` full datasets include a negative bucket only when eval guidance
  supplies an off-skill prompt; template mode no longer guesses canned
  negatives from a fixed question list. CLI and docs now describe `--full` as
  up to four cases instead of always four.
- Fully covered documentation-only skills no longer fail security validation
  solely because non-applicable SkillSpector analyzers report a partial status
  ([#137](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/137)).
- Embedding chunking now rejects zero-sized or non-progressing windows before
  entering the splitter or contacting the embedding provider
  ([#139](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/139)).
- Scoped network exfiltration command flag patterns in security checks, enforcing command-position anchoring, quote-aware argument segmentation, explicit HTTP method flags, and case-sensitive `-F`/`-d`/`-T` flags to prevent false-positive flags on safe URLs, packages, or download scripts while reliably detecting quoted secrets and subshell wrappers.
- Malformed, non-UTF-8, or unreadable bundled and custom policy files now
  produce path-specific CLI errors instead of leaking raw parser or I/O errors
  ([#128](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/128)).
- `create-eval-dataset --refine` resolves Harbor trial case ids from persisted
  `reward.json` `entry_id` metadata, using folder-name parsing only as an
  unambiguous legacy fallback.
- Tier 3 local mode now drops evaluator-managed empty process-loader resets
  while continuing to reject non-empty loader overrides, allowing generated
  tasks to reach agent execution
  ([#132](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/132)).
- Unpinned-dependency warnings are no longer suppressed by comparison
  operators inside PEP 508 environment markers; requirements such as
  `pkg; python_version < "3.13"` are now correctly reported, while direct
  references are treated as pinned independently of marker contents.
- Schema, frontmatter, quality parsing, and security PII scanning accept a leading
  UTF-8 BOM, matching the unicode scanner's "benign BOM" note
  ([#91](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/91)).
- SPDX headers keep the full license expression, so `MIT OR GPL-3.0` is
  no longer truncated to MIT and allowed. Closing comment markers such as
  `*/` and `-->` are not treated as part of the expression
  ([#86](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/86)).
- Windows personal-path PII now flags `C:\Users\...` usernames that start with
  `s` (for example `steve`), matching the intended whitespace class rather than
  excluding the letter `s` ([#87](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/87)).
- Quality scoring, script lint, and `create-eval-dataset` now treat `tools/`
  the same as `scripts/` for executable helpers.
- License detection no longer treats a frontmatter `license` identifier as
  authoritative when a LICENSE file declares a different license. Claiming
  MIT while shipping GPL-3.0 now fails closed. Every LICENSE/COPYING file is
  reconciled, NOTICE files stay informational, an unidentified license file is
  not treated as absent, and a blocking conflict no longer publishes
  `license_status=allowed`
  ([#85](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/85)).
- `--llm-verify` now refuses to send file context from paths outside the
  skill root, including `..`, absolute paths, and outbound file symlinks.
- Gitleaks path allowlist now skips test/example/fixture/mock directories
  instead of any path containing those substrings, so files like `latest.py`
  are scanned.
- Gitleaks CI now limits pull-request and push scans to history reachable from
  the checked-out commit, while audit events retain all-ref coverage,
  preventing unrelated refs from causing false failures
  ([#106](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/pull/106)).
- The Tier 3 agent runtime preflight now fails with an actionable diagnostic when
  the results directory is not visible to the Docker daemon. Previously the smoke
  run passed -- agent output travels over the Docker exec API rather than through
  the mounts -- and every scored trial then failed with `RewardFileNotFoundError`
  while the rewards sat inside the daemon's own filesystem.
- Dead-link validation now uses the shared CommonMark parser, covering
  reference-style and HTML links while preserving Markdown image checks and
  consistently normalizing local destinations. Root-absolute URLs are ignored
  instead of being treated as host paths; href-only diagnostics collapse
  repeated links to the same normalized target. Invalid destination bytes do
  not alias other files, relative URLs that normalize to absolute or
  drive-relative paths are reported without lookup, lookup failures remain
  per-link findings, and link diagnostics are bounded and escaped. Malformed
  frontmatter and repeated unclosed HTML comments no longer abort or stall
  supporting-document checks.
- Tier 3 accuracy and custom goal judges now retry one malformed (including
  empty) or schema-invalid response with a 4096-token output budget before
  failing closed, preventing a transient formatting error from making an otherwise
  successful trial and its full comparison arm unscoreable. Generated and
  injected Harbor verifier configs now reserve 600 seconds for six sequential
  direct provider attempts plus fail-closed artifact writes. Explicit native
  task timeouts remain owner-controlled and are not rewritten, and whole jobs
  defer to Harbor's task-configured phase controls instead of a hidden two-hour
  cap
  ([#70](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/70)).
- PII scanning no longer treats Markdown ATX headings as code comments, so
  emails in headings such as `# Contact: ...` are flagged. Hash lines inside
  Python strings, YAML scalars, and shell heredocs are scanned too. Real
  comments stay skipped, including YAML frontmatter, fenced code, and
  `requirements.txt` ([#88](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/88)).
- Tier 3 Harbor collection no longer scans an agent's unstructured transcript
  for runtime-error phrases when the recorded exception belongs to the
  verifier, health check, or task. Correct answers that discuss errors such as
  `401 Unauthorized` are no longer misreported as agent runtime failures.
- SkillSpector reports now use validated version-specific completeness
  contracts. Valid findings from coherent 2.10+ partial scans remain visible
  while the result stays incomplete, and fully covered 2.9.5/2.9.6 `--no-llm`
  reports remain compatible. Contradictory finding or component totals and
  duplicate component identities fail closed. Versioned findings require
  producer paths, and complete reports reconcile universal analyzer work with
  the component inventory. Reports scored before 2.10 finding compaction remain
  accepted. Shipped bytecode findings, source-scoped executable evidence, and
  version-specific finding identities remain authoritative without overstating
  compacted or hidden finding evidence. SkillSpector 2.11+ requires bundled
  execution-surface analyzer evidence; 2.11.1+ uses classification-aware
  finding IDs while rejecting conflicting reuse of an ID.
- Tier 3 paired pass@k evidence now respects Python's active integer-string
  conversion limit, preserves nonzero Wilson interval widths and paired-effect
  directions at large case counts, and documents exact-rational omission
  markers.
- Tier 3 now decodes bounded native Codex `exec` wrappers into their static
  tool calls. It preserves call order and outer-call provenance, maps an outer
  observation only when its rendered inner call is known, keeps ambiguous
  observations explicit, and reports unsupported or malformed JavaScript as
  untrusted instead of a clean security result.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Added a public benchmark publication gate, regression coverage, and a
  documented rollout plan for generated `BENCHMARK.md` cards.
- Tier 3 pass@k results now include per-arm 95% Wilson score intervals and,
  when case identities pair completely, direction-preserving paired outcomes
  with a two-sided exact McNemar diagnostic, its attainable-p resolution limit,
  and the paired pass-rate delta.

### Changed

- Unified Tier 3 scoring around the canonical five dimensions, persisted an
  immutable dataset-truth snapshot with provenance metadata, and redesigned
  `BENCHMARK.md` as a decision-first publication card.
- Updated public OpenAI / Anthropic / Bedrock chat defaults to pinned frontier
  models (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `claude-opus-5`, `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5`),
  centralized in `provider_config`, and documented `gpt-5.4-mini` as the
  lower-cost OpenAI `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_MODEL` alternative. Raised
  dimension/insights judge token budgets to 4096 and widened the gpt-5\*
  temperature guard to bare model IDs.

### Fixed

- Tier 3 now exercises each resolved agent route and the enabled standard-
  grading route against its provider's model catalog before image preparation
  or task staging. Definitive native-provider authentication and deterministic
  Bedrock credential/configuration failures stop immediately with a redacted
  diagnostic. Non-authoritative OpenAI catalog permission/membership results,
  public or compatible catalog success that does not authenticate inference,
  compatible-gateway catalog authentication, transient failures, and native
  Harbor judge selection resolved only at runtime continue as degraded checks.
  Redacted per-route outcomes are retained even when the later agent runtime
  preflight fails ([#71](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/71)).
- Tier 3 Harbor collection now accepts the `step_results: null` sentinel
  emitted for successful single-step trials while retaining fail-closed
  validation for malformed non-null multi-step result containers.

- Tier 3 eval-dataset generation now parses `SKILL.md` frontmatter as YAML.
  The previous line-based scan captured block-scalar indicators verbatim, so a
  `description: >-` became the literal string `>-` in every generated prompt,
  and multi-line quoted scalars were silently truncated to their first line.

- GitHub Actions pull request reports now link source targets to the checked-out
  repository revision instead of the synthetic `<number>/merge` ref, preventing
  broken or cross-repository links.
- Tier 3 LLM insights now receive explicit labels and bounded expected-behavior
  context for `expected_skill: null` negative controls, and the judge is
  instructed not to flag unrelated successes without invocation or
  failed-routing evidence.
- Fixed Anthropic API-root normalization across evaluator and Claude Code
  paths, and made required Tier 3 judge failures fail closed instead of
  appearing as numeric zero scores or publishing misleading quality results
  ([#55](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator/issues/55)).
- Tier 3 now normalizes host-configured `LLM_JUDGE_MODEL` and
  `SKILL_EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL` overrides in Harbor's parent process and forwards
  the selected value through its verifier-only job layer for standard grading.
  This lets native separate-verifier placeholders resolve without injecting
  either name into the evaluated agent's initial environment. Skill-authored
  `runtime_env` and native task `[environment.env]` tables cannot set or alias
  either operator-controlled override.
  Native verifier declarations remain compatible, while the job-level value
  takes precedence during standard grading. Tier 3 results now record the
  configured judge provider, model, source, and whether a dedicated job-wide
  override was applied, separately from agent models. A provider fallback may
  still use a different model for an individual judge call.
- Quality scoring now uses boundary-aware lexical matching and CommonMark-parsed
  structural links instead of hand-written Markdown parsing or regex inference
  of author intent. Deterministic checks no longer infer MCP negation, temporal
  intent, README guidance, or exclusivity from prose;
  use `rubric-eval` for semantic documentation judgments and Tier 3 for
  observed agent behavior.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-18

### Security

- Secure Docker exec redaction now ignores environment values shorter than eight
  characters, matching the exact secret length floor used elsewhere. Short
  flags such as `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_POLICY_SKILLS=1` no longer rewrite digits
  in `docker exec` output, which had broken NVIDIA Build bridge loopback
  origins during Tier 3 preflight.

### Changed

- Added explicit `--block-on-dedup` / `--no-block-on-dedup` and
  `--block-on-agent-eval` / `--no-block-on-agent-eval` controls with
  backward-compatible defaults, Tier 3 source preflight, and consistent gating
  metadata across CLI, JSON, Markdown, and HTML reports.
- Reduced pull-request runner use for changes confined to `docs/**` and
  `fern/**`: DCO, Gitleaks, and pinned Fern validation still run, while mixed
  and non-docs changes retain the complete Linux, macOS, Windows, packaging,
  and security matrix. Superseded pull-request CI and security runs are
  cancelled so they do not consume runners after a newer commit is pushed.
  Path classification executes from the pull request base revision so a
  change cannot weaken its own CI routing.

### Fixed

- Quality scoring now uses boundary-aware and context-aware matching for XML tags,
  reserved names, MCP guidance, README references, time references, exclusivity
  language, instruction action verbs, and nested Markdown links, avoiding
  incidental-word score changes.
- Tier 3 generated tasks now stage only an entry's declared `files`, preventing
  undeclared fixtures from the shared `evals/files/` directory from appearing
  in that task's `/workspace/input/`, while preserving copy-all behavior for
  legacy entries that omit the field. Agent-visible target, reference, and
  workspace skill projections now omit evaluator-owned `evals/` directories
  from every staged skill package, including sanitized `--copy-repo` contexts,
  while graders, native tasks, custom
  environments, and declared inputs continue to load from the source dataset.
  Authenticated historical result trees are also excluded after output rotation,
  invalid markers fail closed, and late Codex, Cline, Goose, and Qwen
  skill-discovery roots are reset before agent execution. Pre-upgrade custom
  result roots outside `evals/` have no authenticity marker and cannot be
  distinguished safely from authored runtime content. Move or delete that old
  content before `--copy-repo` or other full-context evaluation, then rerun with
  this version if replacement evidence is needed. Explicit task inputs cannot
  select evaluator-owned datasets, configuration, graders, tests, native tasks,
  environments, or results. Every agent and baseline arm now reads from one
  private, selective evaluator snapshot containing the active control files,
  task-source data, consumed fixtures and grader, and the complete authored
  custom environment. Legacy omitted-file entries retain the full shared files
  corpus. Unrelated evaluator subtrees and generated results stay outside the
  snapshot. MCP configuration and completed-run artifacts are
  read through bounded descriptor-anchored roots; on Windows, selected file
  handles deny concurrent writes and deletes while live. Historical unmarked
  runs created before canonical run-level `result.json` remain discoverable only
  when their stable configuration and summaries satisfy the complete historical
  schema. Pre-status scored summaries remain consumable, coherent status-era
  failures remain visible without contributing scores, and marked current
  partial runs continue to fail closed.
- Tier 2 scans now validate but do not follow the exact contained
  `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` compatibility alias, scanning the exactly named,
  independently discovered, single-link regular target once while continuing
  to reject hard-linked selected files, linked manifests, directories, and all
  other file redirects.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-05

### Added

- CI DCO check that fails pull requests whose commits lack a `Signed-off-by`
  trailer, matching the sign-off requirement in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Initial public release candidate.
- Enabled optional semantic-version validation in the default Tier 1 pipeline,
  including a public `--previous-version` monotonic-bump bound.

- Added NVIDIA Build live-agent paths: direct OpenCode support plus Docker
  compatibility bridges for Codex and experimental Claude Code, including
  multi-turn tool-call continuation.
- Fern documentation site configured for `docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator`,
  building the `docs/` guides (installation, configuration, and the three
  evaluation tiers) as MDX pages.
- Expanded the documentation site to fifteen pages — quickstart, eval
  datasets, agents and sandboxes, custom graders, reports, CI integration,
  CLI reference, and environment variables — under a task-oriented
  navigation, with every command verified against the current CLI.

### Security

- Isolated NVIDIA Build bridge credentials from vendor CLI processes using a
  transient, root-managed, container-only key handoff with cleanup on failure.
- Removed NVIDIA Build secrets from Harbor and Docker exec arguments using a
  host-only key file, a non-secret subprocess sentinel, and per-exec container
  handoffs; provider-secret aliases in `runtime_env` are rejected.
- Hardened compatibility-bridge startup with a dynamic loopback port and
  authenticated, process-bound readiness instead of a fixed health endpoint.
- Tightened local macOS Seatbelt policy so nested workspaces can traverse home
  directory metadata without gaining directory-listing or sibling-file access.
- Removed implicit host-side pytest execution from default Tier 1
  code-integrity validation. Test evidence is now collected with contained,
  filename-only discovery that does not import or execute target-controlled
  Python code.

### Changed

- Simplified the repository README into a concise documentation landing page,
  retained a compact keyless `validate` quickstart, LLM-provider setup, and a
  one-command `validate --full` path through all three tiers, broadened the
  project description to agent artifacts starting with agent skills, and moved
  detailed guidance to `docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator`.
- Added Tier 3 cost-planning guidance, including trial-volume multipliers,
  cost-saving flags, and the cost and isolation tradeoffs of local mode.
- Standardized the product name as `SkillEvaluator` across documentation,
  repository metadata, CLI output, and generated report artifacts.
- Removed the optional OpenTelemetry integration, the
  `skillevaluator[telemetry]` extra, and the `skillevaluator.telemetry` Python
  module from the public distribution. Imports of that module now fail rather
  than providing the former telemetry and safety helpers. Redaction and
  child-process environment filtering remain available from
  `skillevaluator.utils.redaction` and
  `skillevaluator.utils.process_environment`; direct Protobuf and OpenTelemetry
  dependencies are no longer installed.
- Changed the public OpenAI default to `gpt-5.4-mini` and the NVIDIA Build
  default to `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b`; OpenCode, Codex, and experimental
  Claude Code now resolve that Build default without redundant model flags.
- Tier 3 now streams staging, arm submission, completion, failure, collection,
  and report-writing progress instead of appearing idle during Harbor startup.
- Tier 3 now reports structured agent/provider failures such as NVIDIA Build
  capacity exhaustion instead of scoring a no-trajectory fallback or emitting
  a generated Harbor task-name mismatch.
- Replaced provisional `test_coverage`, `tests`, and `coverage_percent` output
  with one `test_discovery` detail. Reports now include `test_count`, supported
  filename patterns, `execution_performed=false`, and
  `coverage_measured=false`; projects must run tests and measure coverage in a
  trusted environment or explicit sandbox.

### Fixed

- Public benchmark cards now omit policy profiles, redact absolute host paths,
  and normalize imported internal or retired metadata before publication.
- Previous-version validation now rejects catalog-wide scalar reuse and removal
  of an already bounded `metadata.version` label.
- Tier 1 and Tier 2 now ignore only the exact public SPDX metadata preamble,
  distinguish package versions from network addresses, recognize canonical
  `agents/` and `tests/` support directories, and keep Ruff on the validated
  0.15 release line.
- Accepted structurally complete SkillSpector finding reports on policy exit 1
  and hardened validation of the external scanner's untrusted JSON contract;
  SkillSpector remains separately installed and unpinned by this distribution.
- Programmatic dataset generation now returns explicit created, preview, and
  unchanged outcomes, preserves actionable failures, and no longer mutates
  process-wide command-line arguments.
- Security and full-feature installs now work on RHEL 8 and other glibc 2.28
  Linux systems by keeping Semgrep and SkillSpector in separate tool
  environments while retaining compatible bundled Python dependencies.
- Tier 2 content collection now prunes configured evaluation and version
  artifact directories before enforcing the discovered-path limit, so excluded
  generated results cannot cause false path-count failures.
